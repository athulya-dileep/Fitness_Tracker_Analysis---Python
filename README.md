# Fitness_Tracker_Analysis---Python

# Project Overview
This project analyzes a fitness tracker dataset to provide insights into workout patterns, calorie burn, and overall fitness performance. The analysis involves data cleaning, computation of new metrics, and visualization using both static (Matplotlib) and interactive (Plotly) charts.

# Fitness Tracker Analysis: Process Overview

The Fitness Tracker project helps analyze users’ workout and health data to gain insights into fitness habits, calorie burn, and overall activity. The analysis follows this process:

(*) Data Collection: Gather data from fitness trackers, including workout frequency, session duration, calories burned, heart rate, age, weight, and body fat percentage.

(*) Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates and handle missing values to ensure accurate analysis.

(*) Feature Engineering: Calculate metrics like Calories per Workout and Workout Efficiency to better understand performance.

(*) Descriptive Analysis: Compute averages, maximums, and totals to summarize key fitness metrics.

(*) Data Visualization:

-> Use histograms and scatter plots to examine trends in workouts and calories.

-> Use correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.

-> Use interactive Plotly charts for deeper insights (scatter, box, and bar charts).

(*) Insights and Reporting: Identify the most active age groups, highest heart rates, top-performing groups by calories burned, and patterns in workout habits.
